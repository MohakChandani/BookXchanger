## Introduction
BookXchanger is a website where a person can buy or sell his books. Every year we see that if a student wants to buy second-hand books he has to ask everyone whether they have books or not. Similarly if a person wants to sell his old books he has to ask everyone and search for buyers. So we try to create a platform where a person can buy or sell his second-hand books without any difficulty. 
So we try to make a BookXchanger website with almost all the features which  can resolve all the problems the buyers or sellers face while buying or selling a book.

## Features
- While signup we provide two options, a user can sign up either using his Email or he can use Google account to signup faster.
- We provide a Dashboard for every user where he can keep track of all the books which are available for selling. He can disable book ads or change their information as per his convenience. He can also keep track of active ads and sold ads.
- We provide a Chat feature for every user where they can contact the seller and talk about the deal.
- We don’t collect the mobile number of any user so they don’t get any random calls from buyers or sellers. Similarly we don't reveal any user Email.
- The website is user friendly for all buyers and sellers. Sellers can easily post and edit their books' ads. Buyers can easily search for the book they want with advanced search features.
- There is a chatbot on the home page so if a user faces any issue he can directly contact the bot and immediately one of our agents will be in contact with the user to solve the problem.
- We have a zero tolerance policy so if any user posts any inappropriate ads or tries to message somebody irrelevant other users can directly contact us through chatbot and we will remove that user.
- Visitors can give us feedback on our About us page and help us to improve our website.
- If a user receives any message and suppose he/she is offline then we will send a reminder mail to the user that he has received a new message.

## How to Use

### Buyer
- First of all, buyers have to sign up to access more features of our websites. But buyers can view Book ads without login also .
- Buyer can click on  “BookInfo” of a book to get detailed information about it.
- If a Buyer wants to buy that book , he/she can click on the  “Contact Seller” button, so that he will be able to chat with the seller on our website only .
- So, both buyer and seller can decide further details about purchasing the selected book.

### Seller
- First of all, sellers  have to sign up to authorize themselves for selling books. But sellers cannot sell books without login.
- Then the seller can click on the Sell Ads Button on the top right corner and a new page will open which will contain different fields related to the book like Book Name, Branch, Subject, Price, Edition, Image of book and many more.
- At last the seller will get a Submit Button, on clicking it Book Ad will be live on our webpage.
- So whenever some buyer tries to contact the seller regarding the book he will just message the seller and the seller will get notification by email if he/she is offline.
- Then both buyer and seller can decide further details about purchasing the selected book.
